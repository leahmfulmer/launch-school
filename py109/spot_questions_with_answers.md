## Type coercions: explicit (e.g., using int(), str() and implicit)

### 1: Which variable is coerced? Is it implicit or explicit coercion?

```python
x = 3.5
y = 5
z = x + y
```

> (The variable x is assigned to the float 3.5, the variable y is assigned to the integer 5. The variable  z is assigned value of x + y which is a float, this is an example of implicit coercion)

### 2: What coercion is happening here? Is it implicit or explicit?

```python
a = 1
b = 2
print(a + b)
```

> (The value of the two integers added together is the integer 3. The print function coerces the 3 into a string, the print() function always coerces any argument into strings. This is an example of implicit coercion)

### 3: What coercion is happening here? Is it implicit or explicit?

```python
month = "December"
day = int(input("What day is it? "))
print(f"Today is the {day} of {month}")
```

> (The user is prompted for the day of the week. The value from the user is explicitly coerced into an integer with the int() function and assigned to the variable day. The print() function is called with an f-string prefix which allows string interpolation. Any expressions within the {} are replaced by the value of the expressions. The values are coerced implicitly into strings The concepts demonstrated here are string interpolation and both explicit and implicit coercion)

## Numbers, including handling exceptions (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError)

### Basic questions:
- Are integers and floats mutable or immutable? (Immutable)
- Are integers and floats primitive or non-primitive? (Primitive)
- Are integers and floats literals? (Literals)
- What is a literal? (Any syntatic notation that lets you directly represent an object in source code.

### 1: What does this return and why? What concept does this cover?

```python
def convert_to_int(string):
    try:
        converted_integer = int(string)
        return converted_integer
    except ValueError:
        return "That string cannot be converted to an integer"

print(convert_to_int("hello"))

print(convert_to_int("5"))
```

> (The defined function convert_to_int()takes one argument, a string and then explicitly coerces it into an integer. A try except block tests the value for a ValueError. If it passes it, the converted integer is returned. If it does not pass, then the warning string is returned. The concept here is explicit coercion, try except blocks,and ValueError’s.)
> 
> The second call to `convert_to_int` passes a valid string number to the function. In this case, the string is explicitly converted to an integer and returned from the function. The return is passed to the `print` function which then implicitly converts the integer `5` back into a string `"5"`, for output.

### 2: What does this return and why? What concept does this cover?

```python
def division(number1, number2):
    numerator = number1
    denominator = number2

    try:
        result = numerator / denominator
        return result
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return "The denominator cannot be zero"

print(division(5, 0))
```

> (The defined function division takes two integer parameters and divides the 1st number by the 2nd number. The try, except block tests the result for a ZeroDivisionError. If the mathematical value passes the test it is returned. If the value does not pass, then the string “The denominator cannot be zero” is returned. The arguments 5 and 0, when passed to the function division returns the warning string  which is then printed. The concept demonstrated here is try except blocks and ZeroDivisionError’s)
> 
> While not demonstrated here, when `print` is passed a non-string value, it will implicitly coerce the value to a string for output. If we were to call `division` with a non-zero integer for the denominator and the function returned an integer, `print` would *implicitly* coerce it into a string for output.

### 3: What does this print and why, what concept does this demonstrate?

```python
def addition(number1, number2):
    number1 += number2

x = 1
y = 2

addition(x, y)
print(f"x is {x}, y is {y}")
```

> The defined function addition takes two parameters, both integers and then adds the two integers together using the += shortcut operator. The function addition does not explicitly return any values. Because integers are immutable, the function addition does not modify the variable x as expected. This prints x is 1, y is 2. The concept here is the immutability of integers.)


### 4. What does this print and why? What concept does this cover? How would you refactor this to remove the space?

```python
print(2 + 3 * 4, 4 * (3 + 2))
```

> (This will output `14 20` to the screen. Integers can be added together within a print function. The comma allows multiple different mathematical calculations to occur within the same print() function call. This  To remove the space in the output, use the optional sep=  parameter with and empty space ’ ‘. print(2 + 3 * 4, 4 * (3 + 2), sep=' ') The main concept here is order of operations, and the use of commas to allow for separate mathematical operations within a print() function.)

### 5. What can be used in place of commas to make this more readable?

```python
print(123112940)
  (Underscore can replace commas print(123_112_940))
```

## Strings

### Basic questions:
- Are strings mutable or immutable? (Immutable)
- Are strings primitive or non-primitive? (Primitive)
- Are strings literals? (Literals)
- What is a text sequence? (strings of characters)
- What kind of characters are used in a string? (Unicode characters)
- Are text sequences the same as ordinary sequences? (No, text sequence contain only string characters. ordinary sequences refer to any other sequence types that store multiple elements (e.g. lists, tuples, ranges))

### 1. What is the output of this code, and why? What is the concept covered here?

```python
str1 = "Hello, world!"
sub1 = str1[8:12]
print(sub1) # ?

sub2 = str1[::-1]
print(sub2) # ?

sub3 = str1[::2]
print(sub3) # ?
```

> (The concept is string slicing, which creates a new string object, a substring,  from the original string object based on the indexing sequence given and the step slice argument if any.  sub1 is returning the characters from and inclusive of index 8 to but exclusive of index 12, or the string world, which is then printed. The substring sub2 returns the entire string, but the slice step argument of -1 reverses the order of the indexing returning the string reversed, or !dlrow, olleH, which is then printed. The last substring returns the entire original string, but the slice step argument of 2 instructs the indexing to skip every other index starting with 1. The new substring has a value of Hlo ol! which is printed.)

### 2. What does this print and why? What concept is this?

```python
print(“Hello\nWorld”)
```

> (This demonstrates the escape  character \. This will print the string `"Hello"` and then create a new line and print `"World"`)

### 3. What does this print and why? What concept is this?

```python
name = ‘Alexander Graham Bell’
print(name[0])
```

> (This will print the character A and it demonstrates accessing strings with indexing syntax.)

## f-strings

### Basic Questions:
- What are f-strings? 

> (string prefix for defining formatted string literals that enables string interpolation)


### 1. What does this print and why, what is the concept?

```python
name = ‘Abraham Lincoln’
print(f’”{name} was a President of the US”)
```

> (This will print Abraham Lincoln was a President of the US. The f prefix in the print function allows the value of the variable to be interpolated and merged with the rest of the print statement. This demonstrates f-strings.)

## string methods

### Basic Questions:
- How do you identify a method versus a function?
> (A method occurs when an object is followed by a . and then followed by a function invocation. Whereas a function is a function invocation followed by () with the object passed into the ()).
